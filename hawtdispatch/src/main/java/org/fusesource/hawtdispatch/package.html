<h2>HawtDispatch</h2>
<p>
    HawtDispatch is an abstract model for expressing concurrency via simple but
    powerful API.
</p>
<p>
    At the core, HawtDispatch provides serial FIFO queues to which runnables may be
    submitted. Runnables submitted to these dispatch queues are invoked on a pool
    of threads fully managed by the system. No guarantee is made regarding
    which thread a runnable will be invoked on; however, it is guaranteed that only
    one runnable submitted to the FIFO dispatch queue will be invoked at a time.
</p>
<p>
    HawtDispatch also provides dispatch sources to handle converting
    events like NIO Socket readiness events into callbacks to runnables
    executed on the dispatch queues.
