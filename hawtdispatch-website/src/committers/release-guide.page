# Release Steps

* check your repo is clean and you are on master branch
* prepare the release

      mvn release:prepare -P release

* perform the release

      mvn release:perform -P release

* update the download.page on the wiki
* blog about the release

## Using a temporary local repo

To avoid pushing to the remote repo in experimental attempts at releasing, you can clone your local repo...

    git clone file:///foo/scala scala-release
    

then edit your **~/.m2/settings.xml** file and add this...

    <settings>
      <profiles> 
        <profile>
          <id>release</id>
          <properties>
            <release-altGitURL>scm:git:file:///foo/hawtdispatch</release-altGitURL>
          </properties>
        </profile>
      </profiles>	

then perform a release in this new **scala-release** directory. This will then push to your local repo, not the remote one.
