[FuseSource](http://fusesource.com) is pleased to announce the availability of
HawtDispatch 1.3.

HawtDispatch is a small ( less than 100k ) thread pooling and NIO event
notification framework API modeled after the `libdispatch` API that Apple
created to power the Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) technology in OS X. It
allows you to easily develop multi-threaded applications without having to
deal with the problems that traditionally plague multi-threaded application
development.

**HawtDispatch 1.3 Highlights**

* Added an assertExecuting method to the DispatchQueue interface.
* Protect against exceptions from the event dispatch source handlers.
* Upgrade to Scala 2.9.0-1

* [Change Log](https://github.com/fusesource/hawtdispatch/blob/master/changelog.md)
* [Documentation](http://hawtdispatch.fusesource.org)
