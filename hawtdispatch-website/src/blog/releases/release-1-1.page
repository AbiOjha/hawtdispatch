[FuseSource](http://fusesource.org) is pleased to announce the availability of
HawtDispatch 1.1.

HawtDispatch is a small ( less than 100k ) thread pooling and NIO event
notification framework API modeled after the `libdispatch` API that Apple
created to power the Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) technology in OS X. It
allows you to easily develop multi-threaded applications without having to
deal with the problems that traditionally plague multi-threaded application
development.

**HawtDispatch 1.1 Highlights**

* Profiler Hooks
* Upgraded to Scala 2.8.1 
* Scala continuations support
