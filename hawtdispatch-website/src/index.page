{project_name:} is a small ( less than 100k ) thread pooling and NIO handling framework API modeled
after the `libdispatch` API that Apple created to power the Grand Central 
Dispatch (GCD) technology in OS X.  It allows you to more easily develop 
multi-threaded applications which can more easily scale to take advantage
of all the processing cores on your machine.  At the same time, it's development
model simplifies solving many of the problems that plague multi-threaded 
NIO development.
