{project_name:} is a thread pooling and NIO handling framework API modeled
after the `libdispatch` API that Apple created to power the Grand Central 
Dispatch (GCD) technology in OS X.  It allows you to more easily develop 
multi-threaded applications which can more easily scale to take advantage
of all the processing cores on your machine.  At the same time, it's development
model simplifies solving many of the problems that plague multi-threaded 
NIO development.

## Features

* Java 1.5 API
* Scala 2.8 API
* Thread Pooling
* Delayed Task Execution
* Priority Task Execution
* NIO Handling
</div>

## DispatchQueue Usage

The most important objects in the {project_name:} API, are the [DispatchQueue][]
objects.  They are Executor objects which will execute submitted runnable 
objects at a later time.  They come in 2 flavors:

[DispatchQueue]: {api_dir:}/DispatchQueue.html 

* __Concurrent Dispatch Queue__: The tasks submitted to the concurrent dispatch queues will execute 
  concurrently and therefore must be thread safe.  The order of execution of the tasks
  is non deterministic.  There are only 3 concurrent queues shared system wide.  One for
  each priority level and can be accessed using the [`Dispatch.getGlobalQueue`][Dispatch_getGlobalQueue]
  method.
  
  [Dispatch_getGlobalQueue]: {api_dir:}/Dispatch.html#getGlobalQueue(org.fusesource.hawtdispatch.DispatchPriority)
  
  Example:
  {pygmentize_and_compare::}
  -----------------------------
  java: In Java
  -----------------------------
  DispatchQueue queue = getGlobalQueue(HIGH);
  -----------------------------
  scala: In Scala
  -----------------------------
  val queue = getGlobalQueue(HIGH)
  {pygmentize_and_compare}
  
* __Serial Dispatch Queue__: Execute the submitted runnable tasks in FIFO order. A serial dispatch queue will 
  only invoke one runnable at a time, but independent queues may each execute their 
  runnable objects concurrently with respect to each other.  Serial dispatch queues are created
  by the application using the [`Dispatch.createQueue`][Dispatch_createQueue]
  method.  
  
  [Dispatch_createQueue]: {api_dir:}/Dispatch.html#createQueue(java.lang.String)
  
  Example:
  {pygmentize_and_compare::}
  -----------------------------
  java: In Java
  -----------------------------
  DispatchQueue queue = createQueue("My queue");
  -----------------------------
  scala: In Scala
  -----------------------------
  val queue = createQueue("My Queue")
  {pygmentize_and_compare}
  
### Handy imports
The examples in this document assume that you have 
added the following imports:

<div class="wide">
{pygmentize_and_compare::}
-----------------------------
java: In Java
-----------------------------
import org.fusesource.hawtdispatch.*;
import static org.fusesource.hawtdispatch.Dispatch.*;
-----------------------------
scala: In Scala
-----------------------------
import _root_.org.fusesource.hawtdispatch._;
import _root_.org.fusesource.hawtdispatch.ScalaDispatch._;
{pygmentize_and_compare}
</div>

### Submitting Runnable Objects

Once you have a reference to a queue object you can use it to 
perform some asynchronous processing.  Example:

{pygmentize_and_compare::}
-----------------------------
java: In Java
-----------------------------
queue.execute(new Runnable(){
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("Hi!");
  }
});
-----------------------------
scala: in Scala
-----------------------------
queue << ^{
  System.out.println("Hi!");
}
// or
^{
  System.out.println("Hi!");
} ->: queue
{pygmentize_and_compare}

## Using NIO

NIO integration is accomplished via a [DispatchSource][] object which is
created using the [`Dispatch.createSource`][Dispatch_createSource] method.  You supply it
the [`SelectableChannel`][SelectableChannel] and the operations your interested in receiving events for
like [`OP_READ`][OP_READ] or [`OP_WRITE`][OP_WRITE] and when it's that NIO event is raised, 
it will execute a runnable callback you configure on a dispatch queue 
you specify. {project_name:} takes care of setting up and managing the
NIO selectors and selector keys for you.

[DispatchSource]: {api_dir:}/DispatchSource.html 
[Dispatch_createSource]: {api_dir:}/Dispatch.html#createSource(java.nio.channels.SelectableChannel,%20int,%20org.fusesource.hawtdispatch.DispatchQueue) 
[SelectableChannel]: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/nio/channels/SelectableChannel.html
[OP_READ]: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/nio/channels/SelectionKey.html#OP_READ
[OP_WRITE]: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/nio/channels/SelectionKey.html#OP_WRITE

Example:

<div class="wide">
{pygmentize_and_compare::}
-----------------------------
java: In Java
-----------------------------
SelectableChannel channel = ...
DispatchQueue queue = createQueue()
DispatchSource source = createSource(channel, OP_READ, queue);
source.setEventHandler(new Runnable(){
  public void run() {
    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
    int count;
    while( (c=channel.read(buffer)) > 0 ) {
      // just dump it to the console
      System.out.write(buffer.array(), buffer.offset(), buffer.position());
    }
  }
});
source.resume();
-----------------------------
scala: In Scala
-----------------------------
val channel:SelectableChannel = ...
val queue = createQueue
val source = createSource(channel, OP_READ, queue)
source.setEventHandler(^{
  val buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024)
  var count=0
  while( (c=channel.read(buffer)) > 0 ) {
    // just dump it to the console
    System.out.write(buffer.array(), buffer.offset(), buffer.position());
  }
});
source.resume
{pygmentize_and_compare}
</div>

Dispatch sources are initially created in a suspended state.  Once the [`DispatchSource.resume`][DispatchSource_resume] method 
is called it will start executing the event handler on the specified queue.  If you later
want to stop processing events for a period of time, call the [`DispatchSource.suspend`][DispatchSource_suspend] method.

[DispatchSource_resume]: {api_dir:}/Suspendable.html#resume()
[DispatchSource_suspend]: {api_dir:}/Suspendable.html#suspend()

## Restrictions on Executed Runnables

All runnable actions executed asynchronously by {project_name:} should be non-blocking
and avoid waiting on any synchronized objects.  If a blocking call has to performed, it should be done 
asynchronously in a new thread not managed by {project_name:}.

## Common Patterns

### Protecting Mutable State
A common pattern that shows up to use a serial queue to synchronize access to the mutable state of an 
object.  Example:

{pygmentize:: scala}
  class MyCounter {
    val queue = createQueue()
    var counter = 0;
    
    def add(value:Int) = ^{
      counter += value
    } ->: queue
    
    def sub(value:Int) = ^{
      counter -= value
    } ->: queue
  }
{pygmentize}

### Asynchronous Cleanup

On many occasions there is a resource associated with concurrent processing, and it needs to be released/cleaned 
up once the concurrent processing has completed.

This can be easily done by configuring a disposer callback on the dispatch queue or dispatch source.  These object support
being reference counted using the [`retain`][Retained_retain] and [`release`][Retained_release] method calls.  They are initially created with a retain count of 1.  
Once the retain count reaches zero, the disposer runnable is executed on the associated queue.

[Retained_retain]: {api_dir:}/Retained.html#retain()
[Retained_release]: {api_dir:}/Retained.html#release()

The following example tries to simulate a case were multiple concurrent tasks are using a shared resource and once
they finish executing that shared resource gets closed.

{pygmentize:: scala}
val stream:PrintStream = ...
val queue = createQueue()
queue.setDisposer(^{ stream.close })

for( i <- 1 to 10 ) {
  queue.retain
  getGlobalQueue << ^ {
    // Concurrently compute some values and send then to 
    // the stream.
    val value = "Hello "+i
    queue << ^{ stream.println(value) }
    // the stream is closed once the last release executes.
    queue.release
  }
}
queue.release
{pygmentize}

Its' also important to note that the enqueued runnable objects increment the retain counter.  The following
version of the above example also only closes the stream after all the values are sent
to the stream:

{pygmentize:: scala}
val stream:PrintStream = ...
val queue = createQueue()
queue.setDisposer(^{ stream.close })
for( i <- 1 to 10 ) {
  val value = "Hello "+i
  queue << ^{ stream.println(value) }
}
queue.release
{pygmentize}
